# XSS Vulnerability Fixes - Outleads

## Overview
This document outlines the DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the Outleads application.

## Vulnerability Description
**Type:** DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Unsanitized input from remote resources (API responses) was being rendered directly into the DOM, allowing potential injection of malicious scripts.

## Root Cause
Data fetched from API endpoints was being rendered directly in React components without proper sanitization. This included:
- User-generated content (names, campaign names, organization names)
- Data used in file downloads (CSV exports)
- Data displayed in tables and modals

## Files Fixed

### 1. **Sanitization Utility Created**
**File:** `lib/utils/sanitization.ts`

Created comprehensive sanitization utilities:
- `sanitizeHtml()` - Escapes HTML special characters
- `sanitizeFilename()` - Removes dangerous characters from filenames
- `sanitizeUrl()` - Validates and sanitizes URLs
- `sanitizeText()` - Sanitizes text for safe display
- `sanitizeEmail()` - Validates and sanitizes emails
- `sanitizePhone()` - Sanitizes phone numbers
- `sanitizeObject()` - Deep sanitizes objects
- `stripHtmlTags()` - Removes all HTML tags

### 2. **Campaign Management Page**
**File:** `app/admin/campaigns/page.tsx`

**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- Campaign names used directly in CSV filename (line 181)
- Campaign data rendered without sanitization in export
- Lead data from API rendered directly in CSV

**Changes:**
- Added `sanitizeFilename()` for safe filename generation
- Added `sanitizeText()` for all exported data fields
- Added `URL.revokeObjectURL()` for proper cleanup

### 3. **Leads Management Page**
**File:** `app/admin/leads\page.tsx`

**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- Lead names, phone numbers rendered without sanitization
- Sector names, product names, campaign names displayed directly
- Filter dropdown options rendered without sanitization

**Changes:**
- Added render functions with `sanitizeText()` for all data columns
- Sanitized all dropdown options (products, campaigns, sectors, agents)
- Protected all user-generated content display

### 4. **Reports Page**
**File:** `app/admin/reports/page.tsx`

**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- Report data rendered directly in tables
- CSV export used unsanitized data
- Filename generation used unsanitized report type

**Changes:**
- Added `sanitizeText()` render functions for all table columns
- Deep sanitization of all data before CSV export
- Sanitized filename generation with `sanitizeFilename()`
- Added `URL.revokeObjectURL()` for cleanup

### 5. **Lead Detail Modal**
**File:** `components/admin/leads/LeadDetailModal.tsx`

**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- Lead details (name, phone, sector, products) rendered without sanitization

**Changes:**
- Sanitized all lead data fields before display
- Protected modal content from XSS injection

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Input Sanitization**
All user-generated content and API responses are now sanitized before rendering:
```typescript
// Before (vulnerable)
<span>{campaign.campaign_name}</span>

// After (secure)
<span>{sanitizeText(campaign.campaign_name)}</span>
```

### 2. **Filename Safety**
Filenames are sanitized to prevent path traversal and XSS:
```typescript
// Before (vulnerable)
link.setAttribute('download', `${campaignName}-leads.csv`)

// After (secure)
const safeFilename = sanitizeFilename(campaignName);
link.setAttribute('download', `${safeFilename}-leads.csv`)
```

### 3. **CSV Export Protection**
All data exported to CSV is sanitized:
```typescript
const formattedLeads = leads.map((lead: any) => ({
  "Full Name": sanitizeText(lead.fullName || ''),
  "Phone Number": sanitizeText(lead.phoneNumber || ''),
  // ... more fields
}));
```

### 4. **Resource Cleanup**
Blob URLs are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks:
```typescript
URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href);
```

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. **XSS Payload Testing**
Test with common XSS payloads in:
- Campaign names
- Organization names
- Lead names and phone numbers
- Product names
- Sector names

Example payloads to test:
```
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
javascript:alert('XSS')
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>
```

### 2. **Filename Injection Testing**
Test filename generation with:
```
../../etc/passwd
<script>alert('XSS')</script>.csv
file:///etc/passwd
```

### 3. **CSV Injection Testing**
Test CSV exports with formula injection:
```
=1+1
@SUM(A1:A10)
+1+1
-1+1
```

## Additional Security Measures Needed

### 1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
Implement CSP headers to prevent inline script execution:
```typescript
// In next.config.js
headers: [
  {
    key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
    value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
  }
]
```

### 2. **Server-Side Validation**
Ensure all API endpoints validate and sanitize input on the server side.

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.

### 4. **Input Validation**
Add strict input validation schemas using Zod for all forms.

## Compliance Notes

These fixes address:
- **OWASP Top 10 2021 - A03:2021 – Injection**
- **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation**
- **SANS Top 25 - CWE-79**

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. **Regular Security Audits**
- Run automated security scans monthly
- Manual penetration testing quarterly
- Code review for new features

### 2. **Dependency Updates**
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Monitor security advisories
- Use `npm audit` regularly

### 3. **Logging**
- Log all sanitization failures
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
- Alert on potential XSS attempts
