## Testing Checklist

### Manual XSS Testing

#### Test Payloads
Test each payload in all form fields:

```javascript
// Basic XSS
<script>alert('XSS')</script>

// Image XSS
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>

// SVG XSS
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>

// JavaScript Protocol
javascript:alert('XSS')

// Data URI
data:text/html,<script>alert('XSS')</script>

// Event Handler
<div onmouseover="alert('XSS')">test</div>

// HTML Entities
&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;
```

#### Pages to Test
- [ ] Campaign creation/edit form
- [ ] Lead creation/edit form
- [ ] Product creation/edit form
- [ ] Sector creation/edit form
- [ ] User creation/edit form
- [ ] Report generation
- [ ] Search fields

#### Expected Results
- [ ] Payloads display as plain text
- [ ] No script execution
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] UI remains functional

---

### CSV Export Testing

#### Test Cases
1. **Create test data with XSS payloads:**
   - Campaign name: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
   - Lead name: `"><img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
   - Product name: `=1+1` (CSV injection)

2. **Export to CSV:**
   - [ ] Campaign leads export
   - [ ] Users export
   - [ ] Reports export

3. **Verify CSV content:**
   - [ ] Special characters properly escaped
   - [ ] No formula execution in Excel/Google Sheets
   - [ ] Data displays as text

---

### Filename Testing

#### Test Cases
1. **Create campaigns with dangerous names:**
   - `../../etc/passwd`
   - `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
   - `file:///etc/passwd`
   - `test\x00.csv`

2. **Export and verify:**
   - [ ] Filenames are sanitized
   - [ ] No path traversal
   - [ ] No special characters
   - [ ] Files download successfully

---

### URL Testing

#### Test Cases
1. **Create campaign with malicious link:**
   - `javascript:alert('XSS')`
   - `data:text/html,<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

2. **Verify:**
   - [ ] Links are sanitized
   - [ ] Copy to clipboard works
   - [ ] No script execution on click

---

## Automated Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests for sanitization functions
npm test lib/utils/sanitization.test.ts
```

- [ ] `sanitizeHtml()` tests pass
- [ ] `sanitizeFilename()` tests pass
- [ ] `sanitizeUrl()` tests pass
- [ ] `sanitizeText()` tests pass
- [ ] Edge cases covered

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=admin
```

- [ ] Admin pages render without errors
- [ ] Forms submit successfully
- [ ] Data displays correctly
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit

# Run SAST tools (if available)
npm run security:scan
```

- [ ] No high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] No known XSS issues

---

## Browser Testing

### Test in Multiple Browsers
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if available)

### Verify:
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Forms work properly
- [ ] CSV exports work
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] XSS payloads don't execute

---

## Performance Testing

### Before/After Comparison
- [ ] Page load times acceptable
- [ ] Table rendering performance
- [ ] CSV export speed
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Blob URLs properly cleaned up

---

## Code Review Checklist

### General
- [ ] All user input sanitized before rendering
- [ ] No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- [ ] No `eval()` or `Function()` with user input
- [ ] No `innerHTML` assignments with user data

### Specific Patterns
- [ ] All table columns use render functions with `sanitizeText()`
- [ ] All dropdown options sanitized
- [ ] All CSV exports sanitize data
- [ ] All file downloads use `sanitizeFilename()`
- [ ] All blob URLs cleaned up with `revokeObjectURL()`

### TypeScript
- [ ] No `any` types without proper validation
- [ ] Proper type guards for user input
- [ ] Null/undefined checks before sanitization

---

## Documentation Review
